                <p>On smaller brochure sites, how your organize your styles isn’t usually a big concern. You get in there, write some CSS, or maybe even some SASS. You compile it all into a single stylesheet with SASS’s production settings, and then you aggregate it to get all the stylesheets from modules into a nice tidy package.</p>

                <p>However, when it comes to larger, more complex projects, how you organize your code is a key to efficiency. Not only in how how much time it takes, but also in how much code you write, and how much a browser has to load. This is especially important when you’re working with a team of themers, and when performance is important.</p>

                <p>This also true for long-term projects with legacy code (read "<a href="http://webuild.envato.com/blog/how-to-scale-and-maintain-legacy-css-with-sass-and-smacss/">How to Scale and Maintain Legacy CSS with Sass and SMACSS</a>" — some nice SMACSS and BEM mixing in there).</p>
